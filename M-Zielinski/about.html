            <p class="big">I’m Polish by origin 🇵🇱, shaped by movement and change.</p>
            <p>I spent eleven years in the UK 🇬🇧, starting at boarding school, continuing through university, and into my first professional role. That period taught me independence early and gave me a deep appreciation for structure, accountability, and thinking for myself. About six and a half years ago, I moved to the Netherlands 🇳🇱, which I now call home.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I’m intentional about staying energised ⚡. I train regularly, do CrossFit 🏋️, and recently ran a marathon 🏃‍♂️. For me, physical discipline isn’t about performance. It’s about consistency, resilience, and showing up well. I strongly believe that having the energy to do what genuinely fuels you outside of work directly shapes the quality of judgment, focus, and presence you bring into it.</p>
            <p>I’m naturally curious 🧠 and tend to experiment with ideas, systems, and habits. I enjoy learning new things, even if I don’t always manage to do it as systematically as I’d like. I read when I can 📚, explore topics that stretch how I think, and stay engaged with emerging technology 🤖 out of genuine interest rather than obligation.</p>
            <p>I also enjoy spending time in worlds that reward patience and depth 🎮. I mostly play single-player video games and occasionally return to MMOs. These are experiences that value immersion, progression, and long-term thinking over instant feedback. In a similar vein, I like cooking dishes that are slightly beyond my comfort zone 🍳. They don’t always work out the first time, but they usually do eventually, which I find oddly satisfying.</p>
            <p>At my core, I’m motivated by growth that comes from repetition, experimentation, and learning 🌱, whether that’s in organisations, teams, or myself. I’m at my best when I can bring energy, perspective, and calm structure to complex situations, and when there’s room to keep improving how things work.</p>
